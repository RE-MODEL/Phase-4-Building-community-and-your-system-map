# REMODEL Phase 4: Building community and your system map

## What is REMODEL?
REMODEL is an initiative to explore how manufacturing businesses can use open source methodologies and principles to develop economically sustainable strategies and business models for physical products. 

Over the course of an 8 weeks design-driven sprint - inspired by the Google Sprint format, but revised into a decentralized, virtual sprint that companies engage in from their own location - the companies will work through a process of tailormade design excercises which leads to a dual goal: To gain an strategic understanding of the possible application of open source principles in their manufacturing industry as well as a concrete sketch for an open source-based strategy and community building approach for one of their existing products.

## Who is behind REMODEL?
REMODEL is facilitated by Danish Design Centre, a publicly funded non-profit agency which specializes in exploring new technology currents through design. REMODEL is furthermore supported by an expert panel of open source experts, practitioners and professional scholars: http://danskdesigncenter.dk/en/remodel-expert-panel.
